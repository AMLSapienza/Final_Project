# Final_Project

The conferences that have been suggested by Galasso are:

 - ICCV
 - CVPR
 - ECCV
 - ICML
 - NeurIPS
 - ICLR

If we want to use any of the papers from these conferences we need to require them to have the following characteristics:

 - Topic should regarding computer vision
 - The paper should have code which we can freely use

Some of the papers so far the fulfill these constraints are:

 - [Pyramid Vision Transformer](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Wang_Pyramid_Vision_Transformer_A_Versatile_Backbone_for_Dense_Prediction_Without_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)
 - [Image Retrieval on Real-life Images with Pre-trained
Vision-and-Language Models](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Liu_Image_Retrieval_on_Real-Life_Images_With_Pre-Trained_Vision-and-Language_Models_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)
 - [LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNetâ€™s Clothing for Faster Inference](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Graham_LeViT_A_Vision_Transformer_in_ConvNets_Clothing_for_Faster_Inference_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)
 - [Learning to Resize Images for Computer Vision Tasks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Talebi_Learning_To_Resize_Images_for_Computer_Vision_Tasks_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) This one does not have git code but seems pretty nice...
